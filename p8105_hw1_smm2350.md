# Homework 1

Load the tidyverse:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

### Create data frame

The below code chunk produces a data frame comprised of: a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution; a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0; a
character vector of length 10; and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”.

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean =1),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("Portland", "Seattle", "NYC", "LA", "Denver", "Chicago", "Boston", "Baltimore", "Atlanta", "Philadelphia"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small", "medium", "large", "large", "medium", "medium", "small", "large", "medium", "small"))
)
```

### Take mean of each variable

The below code chunk attempts to take the mean of each variable in
problem1\_df.

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))
mean_samp = mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))
mean_samp = mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

Taking the mean of the numeric vector, norm\_samp, and logical vector,
norm\_samp\_pos, worked. Taking the mean of vec\_char and vec\_factor
did not work because, as the warning messages indicate, neither argument
is either numeric or logical.

### Convert variables

The following code chunk applies the as.numeric function to the logical,
character, and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

The logical vector is converted to a numeric vector of 0’s and 1’s. The
factor vector is converted to a numeric vector of 1’s, 2’s, and 3’s. The
character vector is not able to be converted to a numeric vector; a
warning message that says “NAs introduced by coercion” results from the
attempt to do so. This is because R tried to coerce the character type
values to the numeric type, but was unable to do so since there were no
commonalities. Similarly, the means of the character and factor vectors
would not have been meaningful, which explains what happened in the
above attempt to take their means.

## Problem 2

### Load penguins

The following code chunk loads the penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Describe dataset

A short description of the penguins dataset using inline R code is
below:

There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the data set, for a total of 2752
data points. The 344 observations include female, male penguins from
three different species - Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo - on three different
islands - Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen - during the years 2007 to 2009. The
mean flipper length of the penguins in the dataset is 200.9152 mm.

### Make scatterplot

Below is a scatterplot with bill length (in mm) on the x-axis, flipper
length (in mm) on the y-axis, and points colored according to species.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

### Export scatterplot

Export scatterplot to project directory.

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```
